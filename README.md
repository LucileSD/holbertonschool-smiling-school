In this project, I implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap.
I didn't have a lot of intructions, I were free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

### Deskop version & mobile version

I used a lot of Bootstrap classes, but I also used a CSS file when I was limited with Bootstrap, for example for some colors or some sizes.
